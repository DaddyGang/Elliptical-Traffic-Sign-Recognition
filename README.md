## Introduction
Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) has been an important topic of autonomous driving and assisted driving systems. Here we implemented *fast ellipse detection algorithm* proposed by [Fornaciari M. et al.](Ref/TSR.pdf) And then constructed and trained a 4-layer Convolutional Neural Network to train the classification model.

- Segment out the region of interest containing the traffic signs
- Classify the segmented image.

Then we tested our model on real data streams and deploy it onto a raspi 3b+ driven vehicle. The camera on the vehicle continuously streams video data to our computer via Ethernet or WiFi. After running the algorithm, an instruction code is sent back to the vehicle to perform corresponding actions accordingly.

### Fast Ellipse Detection Algorithm
Please <a href="/Resources/TSR.pdf">Download our report</a> and read through Chapter 2.1 for the details of how we modify and implement our version of the algorithm. Code is written in c++-11 under directory `/server/EllipseDetectorYaed.cpp`.

In short, the algorithm can be decomposed to the following steps:
- Arch extraction
- Arch clusterring
- Center estimation
- Parameter evaluation

The overall running speed of segmenting one frame is between 5 to 15 ms, which is much more efficient than traditional Hough-transform method.

### Training
Please refer to Chapter 2.2 in <a href="/Resources/TSR_ZJU.pdf">our report</a> for more details.
##### Obtaining the data set
We ran the fast ellipse detection algorithm on 12 traffic sign pictures, namely "Left-Turn", "Stop", etc. This way, all the data we capture are all tagged and containing only the ROI. For the all 5730 datas we have, 4500 were used as the training set, and the rest verification set.
###### Demension Reduction
We use first normalize our raw image data to 40-by-40 grayscale matrices. Then run _Principle Component Analysis_ to further reduce the feature into 388 pixel nodes.
###### Building the Back-propagation Model
There are 4 layers in our model, one input, two hidden and one output. Input layer has 388 nodes, 300100 nodes for each hidden layer and 13 nodes for output layer (one negative class).
###### Precision
